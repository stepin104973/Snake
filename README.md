## Introduction
This console-based  game is a simple application, similar to the Snake game introduced by Nokia in 1997. The player uses the “w”, “s”, “d” and “a” arrow to move the snake. He/she attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer. The player loses the game when the snake runs into the screen border or itself. It gives you an idea of what you can achieve with a relatively simple c program.
